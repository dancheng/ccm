      <h3><i class="fa fa-map" aria-hidden="true"></i> Chronic Care Management</h3>
      <p>The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) recognizes care management as one of the critical components of primary care that contributes to better health and care for individuals, as well as reduced spending.</p>

      <p>Beginning January 1, 2015, Medicare pays separately under the Medicare Physician Fee Schedule (PFS) under American Medical Association Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) code 99490, for non-face-to-face care coordination services furnished to Medicare beneficiaries with multiple chronic conditions. CPT 99490 is defined as follows:</p>

      <blockquote>
        <p><span class="fa fa-quote-left" aria-hidden="true"></span>  20 minutes of clinical staff time directed by a physician or other qualified health care professional, per calendar month <span class="fa fa-quote-right" aria-hidden="true"></span></p>
      </blockquote>

      <p>Chronic care management services, at least 20 minutes of clinical staff time directed by a physician or other qualified health care professional, per calendar month, with the following required elements:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Multiple (two or more) chronic conditions expected to last at least 12 months, or until the death of the patient</li>
        <li>Chronic conditions place the patient at significant risk of death, acute exacerbation/decompensation, or functional decline</li>
        <li>Comprehensive care plan established, implemented, revised, or monitored.</li>
      </ul>
    
      <h3><i class="fa fa-user-md" aria-hidden="true"></i> Practitioner Eligibility</h3>
      <p>Physicians and the following non-physician practitioners may bill the new CCM service:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Certified Nurse Midwives</li>
        <li>Clinical Nurse Specialists</li>
        <li>Nurse Practitioners</li>
        <li>Physician Assistants</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Only one practitioner may be paid for the CCM service for a given calendar month.</p>

      <h3><i class="fa fa-users" aria-hidden="true"></i> Patient Eligibility</h3>
      <p>Patients with multiple (two or more) chronic conditions expected to last at least 12 months or until the death of the patient, and that place the patient at significant risk of death, acute exacerbation/decompensation, or functional decline are eligible for the CCM service.</p>

      <blockquote>
        <p><span class="fa fa-quote-left" aria-hidden="true"></span> 2/3 of Medicare beneficiaries had 2 or more chronic conditions. About 1/3 had 4 or more chronic conditions. <span class="fa fa-quote-right" aria-hidden="true"></span></p>
      </blockquote>

      <p>CMS requires the billing practitioner to furnish a comprehensive evaluation and management (E/M) visit, Annual Wellness Visit, or Initial Preventive Physical Examination (IPPE) to the patient prior to billing the CCM service, and to initiate the CCM service as part of this visit/exam.</p>
